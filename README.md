## Project Overview
This project analyzes a healthcare insurance dataset with 1000+ records to uncover insights into customer demographics, claim patterns, and premium trends. Cleaned and structured the data using SQL to answer key business questions and provide actionable recommendations. The analysis highlights opportunities for optimizing premium pricing strategies and enhancing customer service experiences. A Power BI Dashboard / Report was also created to expand on the analysis and have a visual representation and reference for key metrics.

## Objectives
- Analyze demographic trends (e.g., age, BMI) in insurance customers.
- Evaluate the impact of lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking) on claim charges.
- Investigate regional differences in average charges and customer distribution.
- Examine the relationship between family size, BMI, and claim amounts.

## Key Metrics
- Distribution of customers by age, region, and BMI categories.
- Average charges based on customer demographics:
  - Gender, age group, BMI category, and smoking status.
- Total and percentage distribution of clients in each region.
- Average charges by region and BMI category.
- Relationship between charges and smoking habits.

## Key Insights
